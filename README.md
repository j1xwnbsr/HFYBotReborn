HFYBotReborn
============

The bot used by /r/HFY. It is a direct replacement of the old HFYBot, and currently fulfils all its functionality. The bot is currently undergoing a complete redesign, look at the legacy branch for the older code.

HFYBotReborn uses the RedditSharp API and the mono framework.

The new version of the branch is now non functional. I am currently in the process of building the core of the bot and will then start adding a number of loosely coupled modules.
