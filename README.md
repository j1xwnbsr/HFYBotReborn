HFYBotReborn
============

An attempt to bring the bot belonging to /r/HFY back to life. It is being born anew, now using C# and the RedditSharp API as well as Newtonsoft.Json and HtmlAgilityPack (both come with RedditSharp)

Note that you will have to supply your own copy of the RedditSharp API, it can be found at https://github.com/SirCmpwn/RedditSharp
Build it and it will produce the 3 .dlls needed

The bot is now functional. I am in the process of adding a number of new features now.
