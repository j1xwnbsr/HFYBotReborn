HFYBotReborn
============

The bot used by /r/HFY. It is a direct replacement of the old HFYBot, and currently fulfils all its functionality. The bot is currently being expaned upon and given new funcitonallity (when I get around to it, which I rarely do).

HFYBotReborn uses the RedditSharp API and the mono framework.

For details on the new version of the bot go to [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/2mvzrg/metahfybot_status_post_thing/).
