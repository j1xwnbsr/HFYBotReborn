CURRENT CAPABILITIES:
- Posting comments on OC linking to other OC
- Editing older comments to point to new OC
- Not be too hard on the reddit API (I think)

PLANNED CAPABILITIES:
- Allow users to subscribe to a certain author and be messaged when they post
- Allow users to subscribe to a certain series (as determined by using title) and be messaged when a new part is uploaded
- Leave special notes on certain posts, as determined in an external file (this would be reserved for particularly well known writers and series)
- A second comment linking only to other posts in the same series. While a series will be determined based upon the title, I have no idea how to determine what is or isn't a series (yet)
- Some sort of reference to pancakes

THINGS THAT WILL NOT BE COMING (yet):
- deleting of downvoted comments (not yet been needed, but the API seems to have trouble with deleting posts)
- Sentience (I have read one too may rouge AI sci-fi)
- Automated OC creation (see sentience)
