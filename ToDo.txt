This file will detail stuff that I am presently aiming to do with this bot:

-Post a comment on any text post that is created on the sub, linking to other text posts by the smae author on that sub
-Maximum of one comment per post
-Update old comments with new links
-Auto delete comments on a score of -1

More distant goals could be:
-Allow people to subscribe to a particular author and receive a message when that author posts in the sub
-Leave special notes on posts by certain users.
